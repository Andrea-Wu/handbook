#The Directors

Yeah. Us.

This is personal, so I'll write in first person. I'm Heman and I directed with Qasim.

Below is a small summary of what we do and then some tips based on  what we learned.

# What we do

There's a lot of different approaches to describing what we do. First, I'll describe
the people. Then, I'll describe the timings. Finally, there'll be some miscellaneous
notes and things we have done and recommend that you do.

## People

So below the directors is the entire R&D team. Above, there are the executive directors.
Across, there are fellow directors. Everybody should be friends, but that is what the
ranking looks like.

### Project Leads

You basically need to help these people. But also, you need to trust them.

Project leads tend to have a good idea about their projects and how to run it.
So let them run it.

The key trick to being able to trust your project leads is to pick project leads you trust.
So you have to know the architects. You have to know people. Then, just look at their work
and how they interact with the rest of the team. Some helpful questions might be:
- How did they face a hardship?
- How much have they contributed to R&D?
- How busy are they or will they be?
- How have they interacted with a beginner?

You, as their director, should be able to answer this question. And you should like the
answer you think of for them.

If you have that, you have the best team of project leads you can have. You will be able to
trust them and you will know that you can push them forward.

Because, they really should be independent.

### Architects

You should definitely know your architects. But remember that they work on their project
first and foremost.

They also are likely beginners and don't know that much about HackRU. So help them: you're
the experienced representative, R&D co-director!

Recall that architects are not allowed to submit hacks for a prize at HackRU.

### Other Organizers

Basically, treat organizers as you would the relevant director, except that organizers do not
know everything directors do. So respect them, help them if you can, but remember that they
may not know much about HackRU's general structure.

Also, every team is different, so do not expect the organizers to act the same way as architects
or project leads. Food, for instance, has more or less on organizers. However, finance, might
be as big as R&D.

### Other Directors

The biggest difficulty with other directors is just how little they know about R&D. This should
not be a surprise: they have their own work. But more often than not, they have not been involved
with R&D and don't quite know all the tech.

Otherwise, they're really awesome.

They will suggest projects and keep poking R&D, but you can say no if R&D isn't ready for their
project.

Here are some specifics from R&D's perspective on the other teams. (Basically, how, as R&D, you
might interact with the other team.)

#### Executives

These directors have been directors for a year or so and lead the directing team.

They are very helpful with tracking deadlines and facilitating inter-team communication.

#### MnD

They stole our naming convention.

But they're the closest team to R&D because we must interact with them a lot for the website.
They choose the theme, colors, and help with design. The optimal balance (that we are currently
tweaking) is to have a designer in R&D who provides wire-frames to MnD (or all of HackRU's team)
early on.

It is important to note that the intersection of the teams is large, but not large in comparison
to the overall responsibilities of either team. The web front end is an eighth of R&D and at most
a sixth of MnD (from what I know). MnD is also designing T-shirts, stickers, goody-bags and managing
the social media. So while we need to collaborate, we cannot really push them or expect them to take
the lead.

#### Finance

We ask this team for some quick stuff.

They should read the sponsorship site and approve it.

Also, they provide logos that need to be put on the main site. Remember that nobody at HackRU can
tweak the logos without permission from the sponsors.

#### Logistics

We need to talk to this team for travel reimbursements and day-of floor plans.

Hopefully, we will have converged on a travel reimbursement procedure, but we hope to always confirm
the policy with logistics.

We may call upon them to help with the day-of registration as well.

#### Day-of

We interact with day-of for two major things: judging and day-of registration.

We have the judging platform, so we must agree on the procedure (usually just 1 big
judging rounds with professors judging for everything).

#### VHX

The **V**olunteers and **H**acker e**X**perience team
helps us by providing the people on the day-of - much like any other team.

R&D does not require volunteers except at day-of registration. 5 or 6 do the trick then.

That said, we provide the mentoring platform and the app for VHX. They need documentation on
how to use these tools.

#### Food

We maintain the snack consumption tracking. SnackRU is the hope to do that for volunteers,
but QR-scanning helps tremendously with the food-consumption estimates.

### WiCS

We also help with HackHERS.

The most important thing to know about WiCS is that we don't know a lot: we saw them at their
worst and I don't want to judge them based on it.

They were not a team in 2018, since only one or two people had ever run a hackathon and
people did not have the information they needed to give us.

More generally, HackHERS is about a third of the size of a HackRU, so the organizing
team is smaller, and we few things just about scale to work for HackHERS even if they
wouldn't for HackRU.

We offer them similar deliverables to the above, but have fewer people to bother.

(We will update this in lieu of HackHERS 2019 when, hopefully, both our team and their team
will have delivered an on-time, stress-free, tremendous hackathon.)

## Times

It's important to have a schedule. Big things other teams do and related tips are included.
This is a count-down to the HackRU. Note that the summers, winters, and life, the universe,
and everything, may change the exact dates - these are approximate.

These timings are also based on past HackRUs: not on any real science, just experience.

- (HackRU - 3 months) MnD polls for a theme and finance starts saying "spon doc" (sponsorship document).
- (HackRU - 2.5 months) Spon-doc is roughly done. Look at it to get an idea of the colors
  and designs MnD is thinking of. (It's also good to know.)
- (HackRU - 2 months and 1 week) the design of the site should be known. Optimally, a demo
  of the registration site is live and being discussed.
- (HackRU - 2 months) registration opens. Optimally, travel reimbursement should be here.
- (HackRU - 1 month) food knows its vendors and has probably talked to them. Day-of has probably
  found judges. VHX is busy recruiting. Registration closes for hackers. Sponsorship should be close
  to finalized in most cases, so logos should be appearing on the site.
- (HackRU - 3 weeks) first wave of acceptances. We need to plan workshops. Most projects should be tested.
  VHX should have documentation on using the relevant HackRU apps by now.
- (HackRU - 2 weeks) second wave of acceptances. Workshops happen.
  Logistics definitely has finalized floor plans, so you should prod them about it.
- (HackRU - 1 day) :poop: :fire: Actually, it's usually chill since VHX does a great job with volunteers.
- (HackRU + 2 weeks) site can be taken down and DB dropped (but have a backup - sponsors might ask for aggregates).
  A splash site should be put up. There should be a link to the old devpost so that hackers can claim their prizes.

If HackHERS works off the same schedule, you'll notice that HackRU and HackHERS overlap. So should their preparation,
unfortunately.

## Other Stuff we Do

Qasim and I have been busy outside of R&D too. But there are a few small things that we don't really know who should
continue to do, so I'm just writing it here.

The most tangible thing is the CS club presidents chat. We like that, as an R&D thing, it's very neutral, because
HackRU tends to be. This chat is a quick utility to let clubs talk to each other and share important information.
So anybody should say anything, really. So far we have the following:
- Fizzbuzz (interview prep)
- RUCP (competitive programming)
- WiCS (women in CS)
- IEEE (engineering society)
- RUSTEAM (STEAM society)
- HackRU exec directors
- USACS (general CS society)
- QFC (quantitative finance club)
- COGS (creation of games society)
- SWE (society of women engineers)

Please continue it.

We also promote hackathons, project-building, and inclusivity in programming.
The first two promotions are natural. It also becomes easier to invite architects as you get to know them
(so do that). Once people are at the hackathon, getting them to build a project is not that difficult either:
just talk to them about ideas and most people will at least attempt something.
Inclusivity is a lot harder to measure and be consistent with. But be nice and welcoming.

# Lessons we Learned

## Say no.

## Bother people.

## Test, clean up, and recuperate
