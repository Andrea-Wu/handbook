# History

R&D didn't exist before 2016. In November 2016, particularly, the name architect came to exist.
This was probably the first or second R&D thing that happened. Carlin came up with the idea and
explained it to me (Heman). It was inspired by MIT's tech team.

The name architect was probably the hardest R&D tradition that was decided in 2016. There were
many other ideas: "builders," "creators," "designers," or just "organizers" - and then we settled
on "architects." I think it's important to realise [what and architect is](#what-is-an-architect).
It's odd, since in terms of HackRU's central organization, architects are organizers.

After this, in December and January, we settled on an interview process. The familiar process
was somewhat controversial - HackRU does not interview most organizers, only R&D architects.
Carlin initially suggested that the question merely asked to generate primes.
The question that replaced it was the "contraction contraption."
