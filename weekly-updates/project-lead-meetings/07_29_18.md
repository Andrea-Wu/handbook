## front end

_UPDATES_:  Everything renders, cosmetic issues and feature implementations remain

_QUESTIONS_: 

_TO DO_: Fix issues and do feature implementations, test frantically, merge and rebase by August 3, I'd like about 4-6 users so we could parallelize test flows.  As soon as the visuals are ready CSS-wise, coordinate with me so we could merge them into redux-refactor before the merge into master.

_How are the alumni in your project holding up?_:  Okay for the most part, still waiting on tests

_How much react change to expect?_:  Shouldn't be much from what's there
