_UPDATES_:  We are currently working on the following items:
            -Completing Admin Dashboard
            -Completing Travel Forms
            -Writing Jest tests and soon integrating Enzyme for integration into shallow component renders 
            -Yeeting all that into Travis CI
            -Refactoring code to minimize test trees per function
            -Documentation is still in progress (diagrams are hard)

_QUESTIONS_: Please delay this deploy date for traven and admin, to reflect unforeseen team delays (say right before or right after HackCon weekend)

_TO DO_: There are a growing number of visual issues cropping up which we will need to tackle after Admin and Travel - haven't figured out a deadline for this yet.
