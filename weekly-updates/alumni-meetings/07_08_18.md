## Mentoring Styles

### Arpit

*What sort of meeting styles are you used to?*

-Used to weekly, 1-hour "staff" meetings where the lead will share updates across all work related to team, and where people have a chance to bring up whatever they want to bring up

-Have had previous experience where teams will have scrum meetings/daily standups where people will just update the team on what they did, what they are planning to do, and what issues they are facing

-1-on-1's

-Retrospective meetings--kinda like how we did post-moterm, but these meetings are more frequent because they happen at the end of a sprint in agile software development

-Planning meetings--same vein a s retrospective except they happen at the beginning of a sprint, and used to delegate tasks to teammembers

*What sort of meeting styles would you like to try out with your team when paired?*

It really depends on the project and who the team lead is. Also, what the general skill level/vibe of the team. Daily standups/scrums will not be possible for me due to the time difference, and I'm pretty sure would still be difficult given that everyone's schedules are different. For the purpose of mentorship, I'd love to do 1-on-1's, but at the very minimum, I would like a meeting with either the team lead or the majority of the team so that they have a chance to pick my brain and I can give feedback to the larger group.

*What frameworks/tools/programming languges have you used/are comfortable with?*

-HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, React, Selenium), Python (Flask, pyATS), Java (Selenium, RestAssured -- which I would need to brush up on), SQL, C, Eclipse, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator
